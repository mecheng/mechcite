	abstract = {The melting of an ABS resin was simulated using a three-dimensional finite element simulation of the two-phase flow in the compression section of a single-screw extruder. Screw freezing experiments were also conducted to compare the numerical predictions with the corresponding experimental data. Numerical simulations as well as experiments exhibited the Maddock inciting mechanism and numerical predictions were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The sensitivity of the melting profile to various material properties and processing conditions was numerically analyzed. With a constant flow rate enforced at the entrance of the screw channel, the screw and barrel temperature were found to have a minor effect on the melting profile. However, these parameters were found to have a significant effect on the predicted pressure profile along the screw channel. When the zero-traction boundary condition was imposed at the entrance of the screw channel, a change in the screw or barrel temperature affected the flow rate in the screw channel, which resulted in a significant change in the solid fraction at the same cross-section.},
